# Scaling-Dungeon-Crawl

This project is a game designed to be a brief foray into AI, pseudo random generation and scaled difficulty.

A dungeon is generated at the start of every new level with enemies of different AI behavior and therefore difficulty. These enemies are generated with randomization while adhering to difficulty scaling. The game's difficulty scale stat will increase every level but will increase more depending on the players performance. If the player scores higher the difficulty will spike harder, thus making the game more challenging sooner for better players. The difficulty setting effects the number of enemies spawned as well as their type.

There are three types of enemies, easy medium and hard. The easy enemies simply wander, the medium enemies will head in a straight line for the player and the hard enemies will put themselves between the player and the objective. The goal of the game is simply to reach the objective, but defeating enemies will add to the score.
